# Web3 Message Board

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. I deployed a smart contract that allowed users to write a message about why they decided to get into crypto onchain, developed a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks to test my code out:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
